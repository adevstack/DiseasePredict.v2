---

**🧠 AI-Powered Disease Prediction & Treatment Recommendation Application**

Create a **streamlined, AI-powered disease prediction platform** that uses **Hugging Face Transformers** for symptom analysis and provides accurate disease predictions, treatment recommendations, medicines with purchase links, and more. The app will be designed to be deployed on **Render**, **Heroku**, or similar platforms once development is complete.

### 💡 Key Features:

* **Symptom Selection**: Allow users to select symptoms from a dropdown list and add custom symptoms in text form.
* **Disease Prediction**: Use machine learning (including Hugging Face’s **DistilBERT** model) to predict possible diseases based on symptoms.

  ```python
  from transformers import pipeline

  pipe = pipeline("fill-mask", model="distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased")  # Load model directly
  ```
* **Confidence Levels**: Display confidence levels for predictions.
* **Treatment Recommendations**: Suggest treatment options and medicines.
* **External Pharmacy Links**: Provide links to online pharmacies for purchasing medicines directly after disease prediction.
* **Disease Information**: Show detailed information on diseases, including symptoms, causes, and prevention tips.
* **Medications List**: After a disease is predicted, list medications commonly used for treatment, along with direct buying links to trusted online pharmacies (e.g., **1mg**, **PharmEasy**, **Netmeds**, **CureFit**).
* **User Interface**: Clean, user-friendly medical interface with a **dark theme** (Streamlit).
* **Medical Disclaimers**: Include proper disclaimers for medical information.

### 🧱 Tech Stack:

* **Frontend**: Streamlit for quick, interactive web UI
* **Backend & Model**: Python, Hugging Face Transformers (DistilBERT or other models for NLP tasks)
* **ML Framework**: scikit-learn for disease classification models
* **External Data**: Web scraping or APIs for real-time medical info (e.g., disease databases, pharmacy websites)
* **Database**: Optional database (e.g., MongoDB for storing symptoms and predictions)
* **Security**: Ensure proper error handling, input validation, and authentication (e.g., JWT).

### 🔒 Requirements:

* **Secure, Scalable Code**: Implement error handling, data validation, and the use of HTTPS for secure communication.
* **Data Handling**: Use a comprehensive dataset for diseases and symptoms (e.g., Kaggle, open medical datasets).
* **Model**: Train or use pre-trained **Transformers** models for disease prediction.
* **Styling**: Focus on professional medical styling and a modern, clean design.
* **Deployment Readiness**: Prepare the application for future deployment on platforms like **Render**, **Heroku**, or **Vercel**.

### 🚀 Deployment (Future Steps):

1. **Platform Choice**: Once your app is complete, deploy it on a cloud platform like **Render**, **Heroku**, or **Vercel**. These platforms offer automatic scaling and easy deployment for Python apps.
2. **Continuous Deployment**: Connect your GitHub repository to your cloud platform to enable **automatic deployment** each time changes are pushed to your repository.
3. **Environment Setup**:

   * Use environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., API keys, model paths) with `.env` files.
   * Configure the **requirements.txt** (for Heroku) or **Dockerfile** (for Render/Vercel) to ensure all dependencies are installed.
4. **HTTPS Setup**: Configure **HTTPS** to ensure secure communication for production. Platforms like Render and Heroku offer easy ways to set this up automatically.
5. **Custom Domain Setup**: If you want a custom domain, you can easily link it through the platform's interface (Render, Heroku, Vercel, etc.).
6. **Database Integration**: If using a database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.), ensure the database is also properly set up on the cloud and connected to your app.
7. **Logging & Monitoring**: Set up error logging and monitoring tools like **Sentry** or **Datadog** to track any issues in production.

### 🏥 Key Improvements:

#### 1. **Medications List with Pharmacy Purchase Links**

After the disease prediction, provide a list of common medications prescribed for that disease. Each medication should include:

* **Medication Name**
* **Brief Description** (e.g., what it's used for)
* **Buy Link**: Link to trusted pharmacy websites (e.g., **1mg**, **PharmEasy**, **Netmeds**, **CureFit**).
* Optionally, include **medicine reviews**, **side effects**, and **dosage recommendations**.

For example:

* **Disease**: "Flu"

  * **Medications**:

    * **Tamiflu**: Used to treat the flu. [Buy here on 1mg](link)
    * **Advil**: Over-the-counter pain reliever for flu symptoms. [Buy here on PharmEasy](link)

* **Improvement**: Include a dynamic, regularly updated list of medications with links to reliable, trusted online pharmacies.

#### 2. **Web Scraping Service for Medications**

To fetch real-time medication details from trusted pharmacies like **1mg**, **PharmEasy**, **Netmeds**, **CureFit**, and more, you can implement a **web scraping service** using **BeautifulSoup** or **Selenium**. Below is a basic example to scrape **1mg** and **PharmEasy** for medication details:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Example scraping for 1mg and PharmEasy

# Fetch 1mg product link
def get_1mg_medicine_link(medicine_name):
    url = f"https://www.1mg.com/search/all?name={medicine_name.replace(' ', '%20')}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    product = soup.find('div', {'class': 'style__productItem__2D-0a'}).find('a', {'class': 'style__productItemLink__3JzFQ'})
    link = f"https://www.1mg.com{product['href']}"
    return link

# Fetch PharmEasy product link
def get_pharmeasy_medicine_link(medicine_name):
    url = f"https://pharmeasy.in/medicine-search/{medicine_name.replace(' ', '-').lower()}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    product = soup.find('div', {'class': 'product-card'}).find('a', {'class': 'product-card-link'})
    link = f"https://pharmeasy.in{product['href']}"
    return link

# Example usage for Tamiflu
medicine_name = "Tamiflu"
buy_link_1mg = get_1mg_medicine_link(medicine_name)
buy_link_pharmeasy = get_pharmeasy_medicine_link(medicine_name)

print(f"Buy {medicine_name} on 1mg: {buy_link_1mg}")
print(f"Buy {medicine_name} on PharmEasy: {buy_link_pharmeasy}")
```

This script scrapes **1mg** and **PharmEasy** for medication links. You can extend this logic to scrape other websites like **Netmeds**, **CureFit**, or **Medlife**.

* **Improvement**: Implement a **dynamic scraping system** to fetch the most up-to-date medication details from **Indian pharmacy websites** like **1mg**, **PharmEasy**, **Netmeds**, **CureFit**, **Medlife**, and others, then display the medicines with **buy links** on the user interface.

#### 3. **Displaying Medications**

Once the disease is predicted, dynamically generate a list of medications below the disease result. This list should be populated by calling the scraping function, showing the medication name, brief description, and links to trusted pharmacies.

```python
import streamlit as st

def display_medications(disease):
    # Based on the predicted disease, display recommended medications
    if disease == "Flu":
        medications = [
            {"name": "Tamiflu", "description": "Antiviral for flu.", "buy_link_1mg": get_1mg_medicine_link("Tamiflu"), "buy_link_pharmeasy": get_pharmeasy_medicine_link("Tamiflu")},
            {"name": "Advil", "description": "Pain reliever for flu symptoms.", "buy_link_1mg": get_1mg_medicine_link("Advil"), "buy_link_pharmeasy": get_pharmeasy_medicine_link("Advil")},
        ]
        for med in medications:
            st.write(f"**{med['name']}**: {med['description']}")
            st.write(f"[Buy on 1mg]({med['buy_link_1mg']})")
            st.write(f"[Buy on PharmEasy]({med['buy_link_pharmeasy']})")

# In the Streamlit app, after disease prediction:
disease_predicted = "Flu"  # Example predicted disease
display_medications(disease_predicted)
```

This code will display the **medication list** under the disease prediction result.
